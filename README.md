# Hi!

I'm Hakam Raves, a junior data scientist with 1 year of experience as a data analyst at an oil and gas company. I have gained experience in all aspects of the data science pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to machine learning modeling using Python, and I also have a strong foundation in Microsoft Excel especially for analytics. 

Successfully built and deployed machine learning models, including a sports analytics and other projects with Streamlit dashboard deployment. Currently a final-year double-degree masterâ€™s in applied economics and computer science, where I am interested in applying data science solutions to business and finance.

## Currently Working on
- Freelance Coding Teacher that have a mission on build digital and computational thinking skills for elementary school to high school students in Indonesia.
- Machine Learning, Data analytics and Econometrics approach on business project
- Sports data analytics (Football, Basketball, Handball)

## Featured Projects

### [Telco Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/ravsssh/TelcoCustomerChurn)
I created a model that predicts telecommunication customer churn using machine learning. This model, based on the Neural Network Cl, achieved 95% accuracy. I hope this model can support the efforts of hospitals in diagnosing lung cancer at an early stage, allowing for more effective treatment.
Technology / Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, SHAP.

### [Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ravsssh/Amazon-Sentiment-Analysis)
This project builds a three-class sentiment classifier for Amazon product reviews (positive, negative, and neutral) using modern NLP. The notebook covers data preparation, transformer fine-tuning with Keras/Transformers, evaluation, and inference on new text. 
Technology / Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Keras, Hugging Face Transformers.

### [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/ravsssh/HearthDisease)
This project explores the UCI Heart Disease dataset to predict disease presence (target: num). It includes EDA, cleaning, visualizations, and classification modeling using clinical features like age, chest pain type, cholesterol, and ECG results. 
Technology / Tools: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

### [Sneakers Sales Clustering](https://github.com/ravsssh/SneakersClustering)
This project applies unsupervised clustering to Nike and Adidas sneaker listings (data_nike_vs_addidas_unsupervised.csv) using features like listing price, sale price, discount, brand, rating, and review counts to uncover product segments and pricing/discount patterns. It includes interactive scatterplot outputs exported as HTML via HoloViz Panel 
Technology / Tools: Python,  Pandas,  NumPy,  Seaborn,  Matplotlib,  DBSCAN, KMeansClustering, PCA.

### [German Handball League Season 2021-2022 Data Visualization with Streamlit](https://handballgerman2020datavisualization.streamlit.app/)
Created web-based dashboard: Using streamlit that narrates how player shooting accuracy and attempts by club ranking. 
Visualized tendencies: What shot type every club takes every 100 shots. Shown shooting accuracy and attempt sensitivity: Number of goals based on the machine learning model.
